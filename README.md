# TMS320-DSPkit-Averaging-Filter
In this project, I've gone over the process of using the TMS3206713 DSP kit for filter designing. First, I'll show the steps to correctly download, install and call libraries. Then, I'll go through a simple LED control exercise. Followed by a background study of Averaging Filters and writing an algorithm for it to test against an audio signal.
